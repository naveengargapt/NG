                                        Whenever you enter a query in a search engine and hit 'enter' you get a list of
                                        web results that contain that query term. Users normally tend to visit websites
                                        that are at the top of this list as they perceive those to be more relevant to the
                                        query. If you have ever wondered why some of these websites rank better than the
                                        others then you must know that it is because of a powerful web marketing technique
                                        called Search Engine Optimization (SEO). SEO is a technique which helps search engines
                                        find and rank your site higher than the millions of other sites in response to a
                                        search query. SEO thus helps you get traffic from search engines.

                                    After the Search Engine Optimization process is complete, your website becomes Search
                                    Engine Friendly and gets attention of Google which in turn, makes it visible on
                                    the search results. Most of the business owners use the SEO services for their business
                                    websites to get online visitors and turn them into customers. To run a business
                                    online, you need customers from your targeted area. For Example, you own a pizza
                                    store in your city For Example: "London" and want to get orders online via your
                                    website. When people search for the terms like "Pizza store London" or "Online Pizza
                                    order London" or "Pizza shop in London", your website is nowhere in the search results.
                                    You will surely not be getting orders online because people will not find you. This
                                    is where SEO comes into picture and make your website visible on the first page
                                    of Search Engine. This is obvious that you must be visible to people to get orders
                                    otherwise you are giving winning chance to your competitors.<br />
